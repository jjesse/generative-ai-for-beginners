# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

How you write your prompt to the LLM matters, a carefully crafted prompt can achieve a better result than one that isn't.

Generative AI is capable of creating new content in response to user request. It does this using Large Language Models.

Users can now interact with these models using chat without the need for technical expertise or training. These modesl are prompt-based, users send a prompt, and get back the AI response (completion).

"Prompts" become the primary programming interface for AI apps. "Prompt Engineering" focuses on the design and optimization of prompts.
