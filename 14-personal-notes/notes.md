# Personal notew from setting this up

## Installing miniconda and juypter

- Open up the command prompt (on my Windows 11), launch terminal and then a new Powershell session.

- Install the miniconda app from the download page

- Launch the newly installed miniconda app which is its own terminal session

- pip install jupyter from the running miniconda terminal session

- Launch jupyter notebook from the directory where the files are download

  - In my case it is in C:\Users\j0217\Documents\git\generative-ai-for-beginners

- Started working through the exercises

## Chapter 1 - Introduction to Generative AI and LLMs

### How did we gte Generative AI

Focused on a statisical approach to AI, able to learn patterns from data

A Nueral network and specifically a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) signficantly enhanced natural lanague processing, enabling the represenation of the meaning of text in a better way

This RNN is what powers the modern virtual assitants (Siri, Alexa, etc.)

### Present Day

- Artificial Intelligence (1956)
  - The field of computer science that seeks to create intelligent machines that replicate or exceed human intelligence

- Machine Learning (1997)
  - Subset of AI that enables machines to learn from existing data and improve upon that data to make decisions or predictions

- Deep Learning (2017)
  - A machine learning technique in which layers of neural networks are used to process data and make decisions

- Generative AI (2021)
  - Create new written, visual, and auditory content given prompts or existing data

After a ton of reearch a new model architecture called Transform overcame the limits of RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks)

- Based on the attention mechanism
- Different weights to the inputs it receives 
- "paying more attention" to the most relevant information
